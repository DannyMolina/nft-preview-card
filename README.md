### What I learned

The project was made easier for me with my knowledge that although they are not very extensive I was able to solve the challenge, but my main problem lies in placing the blue element with its icon on the image of the NFT It was something that was difficult for me but I managed to solve it 2 days later


### Continuous development

I would like to focus on learning the effects with CSS, it is something that is difficult for me and I must polish
